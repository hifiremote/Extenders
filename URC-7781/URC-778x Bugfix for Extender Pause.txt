I regret that there is a bug in the Pause special protocol for the
extenders for the URC-7780 and URC-7781 remotes.  The bug prevents
the Pause protocol from working properly, even possibly causing the
remote to crash, once any device upgrades have been added.

To fix the bug, load your current setup into IR.exe, either from a
saved file or by dowloading from the remote.  Go to the Protocols
page and delete the protocol $01FB (highlight it in the left hand
pane and press the Delete button at the bottom of the window).  Now
add the debugged Pause protocol below.  To do this, press the Add
button, paste the appropriate entry given below (all three lines,
including the text) into the Add window just as if you were adding
from RemoteMaster or KM, and then press OK.

You should now have a replacement $01FB protocol in the left hand
pane and the Pause special protocol should work correctly.  Save 
this corrected setup and upload it to your remote.  

This works with both extenders A1 and A2 and does not upset any
settings of your remote.


For the URC-7780 use this upgrade:

Upgrade protocol 0 = 01 FB (HCS08) URC-7780 Debugged Pause (PB v4.01)	   
 20 04 00 00 02 00 CD EF EB B6 B5 4C BE B6 CC FF 9E	   
End


For the URC-7781 use this upgrade:

Upgrade protocol 0 = 01 FB (HCS08) URC-7781 Debugged Pause (PB v4.01)	   
 20 04 00 00 02 00 CD F3 EB B6 B5 4C BE B6 CC FF 9E 	      
End
