All the remotes in this folder have the exact same processor chip installed, so the extenders included here canbe used on any of the following remotes, regardless of how the extender is described.  The only important factor is what size of EEPROM chip did you install, and if it's larger than 2k, what is the special address that it uses.  (The 8811 and 8810w come with a 2k chip pre-installed).
