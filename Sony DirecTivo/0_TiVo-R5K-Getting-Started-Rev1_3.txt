Getting Started in JP1 with Sony TiVo/DirecTiVo and ReplayTV 5000 Remotes

  Rev. 1.3  June 12, 2003 by Hal Takahara


Overview
========

The remotes covered in this guide, Sony RMT-V303, RM-Y809 and the
ReplayTV 5000 remote, are not originally designed to be universal
remotes, and you need to install one of the extender programs to
make it work as one.  For the same reason, these remotes do not have
much in their code libraries, and it is very likely that you need to
add the device codes for most of your devices except for the PVR that
the remote came with.

It'll work as a 12 device remote with macro capability once you
configure the remote.  (Actual number of devices are subject to size of
the EEPROM and each device upgrade.)

  - The TV Power button (R5K, SA TiVo) or the SAT Power button (DirecTiVo)
    works as the Shift key.

  - Shift-0 .. Shift-9 work as the device buttons.  You can make any
    button to work as a device button.  (There are two more device
    indexes that are not pre-assigned to any buttons.  You can assign
    them easily by defining macros that includes the device selection
    commands.)

  - You can define macros to control power, input selection, etc. with
    a single key press.  There are no forced delays between commands
    in the macros, and macros can be nested.


What You Need to Get First
==========================

System Requirements
-------------------

Windows PC with DB-25 parallel port (No USB, serial port support) MS
Excel 97 or above, the Analysis Toolpak installed.  The macro
capability of Excel must be enabled.

JP1 Cable
---------

Build or buy one.  See the Simple Interface folder in the files
section for the instructions to build one, or see the Database section
for the sellers of pre-built cables.  For uses with a low voltage PC,
consider using a Schottky diode (BAT83, 1N5818, etc. not available at
Radio Shack) instead of 1N4148.

JP1 Connector (Sony TiVo/DirecTiVo Remotes Only)
------------------------------------------------

You have to solder on 6 wires and add the JP1 connector.  See
the instruction document in the Hardware folder.

JP1 Tools and Extender
----------------------

Download the following packages in the files section:

Form the Tools folder:

  - keymap-master.zip: Keymap Master spreadsheet (a.k.a. KM)
  - IR???.zip: IR.exe package (??? is the version number)

From the Extenders folder:

  - The extender for your remote.  Use the version 2 if you have
    upgraded the EEPROM in your remote (Sony TiVo/DirecTiVo remotes)
    and version 1 otherwise.


Creating/Adding Upgrades
========================

Finding Codes
-------------

Follow the steps below to find the codes for your devices.

1. Look for the KM file for you devices in the Device Codes folder in
   the files section.  The TiVo/DirecTiVo/ReplayTV upgrades are in the
   PVR sub-folder.

   *Note: If you are going to control multiple non-Sony TiVo, get the
    one based on the "Hacked TiVo protocol" (NOT the one based on the
    NEC protocol.)

You need to create the KM file from scratch if you can't find anything
close to your device.  The following information is needed to do so:

  - The protocol name
  - The device number
  - In some cases, additional parameters
  - The command code (often expressed in different forms - EFC, OBC or Hex)

In general, all the signals from one remote use the same protocol and
only one or two different device numbers, and each different command
code per function.  Combo devices, such as TV-VCR/DVD combo,
mini-systems often use multiple device numbers/protocols.  In this
case, you may need to use a "combo" protocol or the Device Combiner
protocol to make it as a single upgrade.

2. See if the web sites listed the IR code libraries folder in the
   Links section have the codes for your device.

3. If you have a JP1 compatible leaning remote, learn the signals from
   the remote, download the image with IR.exe, and see the Learned
   Signals tab if it shows the information you need.  (Try the new
   decoder DLL with the special version of IR.exe if the regular
   IR.exe cannot decode it.)

4. Look for the Philips Pronto CCF file for your device in the Remote
   Central web site (files section), and use the ccf2efc program to
   extract the necessary information.

The code lists on the www.hifi-remote.com site may be also useful if
you are looking for the command codes to try.

Creating Upgrades
-----------------

1. Open the KM. (Make sure that the macros can run. Be aware of the
   security level.)

2. If you have a KM .txt file to start with, click on the [Load]
   button and choose the file.  Click on the [New] button to start
   over.

3. On the [Setup] sheet,

Remote: Change this to your remote

Device Type: You can leave it as is, or change it to any type. It
  doesn't have to match what your device actually is.  What it does is
  just picking the button layout - some buttons become available/not
  available depending on the type you choose here.  Change it to
  whatever you like.

Setup Code: This can be anything, too. I'd recommend to make it the
  same as the UEI code if it is known and not built-in, or add 1000 if
  it's unused, etc. Just pick the code so every "Device Type"/"Setup
  Code" combination is unique.

Button Codes: Choose either OBC or EFC command code style depending on
  the command codes you've got.  Never mind for now if you are not
  sure.  (Only either code style is available in some protocols)

If you are creating this upgrade from scratch, fill in the Protocol
ID, main/sub device numbers accordingly.  (In some cases, you may also
need to specify the Param.)  Read the protocol read me file comes with
KM to see the protocol specific information and the combo/combiner
protocols.

Unit Code (ReplayTV and Non-Sony TiVo): Specify the ReplayTV unit
  code/TiVo remote address here (To change the remote address for a
  Sony SA/DirecTiVo, see the instructions comes with the KM .txt file
  in the PVR folder.)

  *** To change the code on the PVR side:

    ReplayTV:  http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?s=5dca23cdeacfc45487b7a69b7baea00d&threadid=253263

    TiVo: http://customersupport.tivo.com/tivoknowbase/root/public/tv1087.htm


4. On the Functions sheet, fill in the command codes.  Add new entries
   as needed.  Read the protocol read me file to see how you specify
   the main/sub device for each command.

5. On the Buttons sheet, change the assignment of the functions on
   each button as you like.

6. Go back to the Setup sheet and click on the [Save] button to save
   the work.

Adding Upgrade Codes
--------------------

1. Open the EEPROM image (the initial extender image included in the
   extender package if you are just starting from the scratch.  See
   the Install.txt) with IR.exe.

2. Open KM and load the device file you created, and then click on the
   icon near the "Device Upgrade Code" area.  Go to the Devices tab in
   IR.exe, click on the [Add] button, and then press Ctrl-V to paste
   it.  Check if the Type and the Setup Code are correct.  In case of
   those remotes, all the device types other than TV are mapped to the
   same device type.  For example, you would see VCR here even if you
   chose DVD in KM, etc.  Click on the [OK] button.

3. If KM is showing the message: "The Protocol Code is Required",
   check the Protocols tab in IR.exe if you have already added the
   same protocol for other device.  If you haven't, click on the icon
   near the "Protocol Code" area just below the "Device Upgrade Code"
   area.  Go to the Protocols tab in IR.exe, click on the [Add]
   button, and then press Ctrl-V to paste it.  Click on the [OK] button.

   *** Caution on the Device Combiner: the Protocol Upgrade code for
   the Device Combiner includes sets of the fixed data you specified
   on the Setup sheet, and it is different for every Device Combiner
   upgrade you crate.  Create a single consolidated Device Combiner
   protocol code that includes all sets of fixed data you need, and
   share it across all the device upgrades that use the Device
   Combiner.

Repeat the above steps for all the devices.

Assigning Setup Codes to Device Buttons
---------------------------------------

Go to the General tab in IR.exe and choose combination of Type and
Code for each Device button.

Go to the Macros tab in IR.exe.  There are device selection macros
pre-defined on Shift-0 .. Shift-9.  Each device button name (= device
index) corresponds to the device selection commands (V_, O_ and X_:
V_TV, O_VCR, etc.)  Use a V_ command to specify the device for the
volume buttons and use an O_ command for the other buttons.  The X_
commands overrides the V_ and O_ commands and take effects only within
macros.  Volume keys are punched through to the TV device in the
pre-defined macros for some devices.  Modify them or add new macros
for AUX5/6 as necessary.  Read the ReadMe.txt included in the extender
for more details.


************************************************************************
Save your work so far with the menu: [File] -> [Save] or [Save As...]
At this point, you may want to upload and try the image before start
working on macros, etc.
************************************************************************

Uploading Image and Activating Extender
=======================================

1. Upload the image with IR.exe.  The LED should blink twice.

2. Press the activation key:

  Sony TiVo/DirecTiVo remote: TV Power
  ReplayTV 5000 remote: ReplayTV Power

The LED should blink 4 times.

3. The initial device selection is non-deterministic make sure to
press one of the buttons with the device selection macros.  For
example, press Shift-2 to choose the TiVo/ReplayTV, and the remote is
ready to use.


Repeat 2. and 3. to reactivate the extender after:

  - Uploading the image

  - Replacing the batteries

  - The remote resets itself (weak batteries, connecting/disconnecting
    the JP1 cable can cause reset.)


Defining Macros
===============

In IR.exe, go to the Macros tab and add a macro on a button of your
choice if you would like the macro to be executed regardless of the
current device.

Use the Device Specific Macros feature (DSM) if you would like the
macro to be executed only in a specific device.  To define a DSM, go to
the Key Moves tab in IR.exe, and create a key move with the setup code
TV/1103.  Specify the key codes in hexadecimal numbers as the Hex
Cmd.  (Make sure that the Hex Cmd is selected instead of EFC.)  Key
codes are listed in the KeyCodes.htm and the RDF.

  *Note: Use the Extender Code Calculator spreadsheet in the Extenders
   folder for easier DSM programming.  It calculates the code for
   ToadTog and Long/Double Key Press macros if you use the extender
   version 2.

In order to use a command in macros, the command has to be assigned to
a button (either a physical button or the one that doesn't physically
exist - we call it a "Phantom key") first.

  In the Extender 2 (as well as the regular JP1 remotes), you can just
  create a key move on it (the setup code used in that button does NOT
  have to be tied to any device indexes.)

  In the Extender 1, the setup code must be assigned to one of the
  device indexes since this extender does not support regular key
  moves.  Also, the commands must exist in the key map (i.e. Must be
  assigned to buttons in KM, not as key moves.)  Phantom keys can be
  used to hold macros using other keys, but not to hold direct
  commands with setup codes.

See the Device Specific Macros.txt included in the extender package
for more information about DSM.
